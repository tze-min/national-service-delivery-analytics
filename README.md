# National Service Delivery Analytics

## About

This project processes text data extracted from public sites. Specifically, they're sites hosting discussions of National Service (NS) related services offered by Singapore's Ministry of Defence. Examples of such services include NSmen's experiences at medical check-ups and NSF's experiences in camps. 

Online reviews and forums contain substantial conversations and opinions from the NS community. Hence, this project analyses these netizens' sentiments towards these services and visualises our insights in a dashboard app for our clients: project managers at the Defence Science and Technology Agency.

## Notes

Built for our undergraduate capstone module, my teammates - [@VibhuKrovvidi](https://github.com/VibhuKrovvidi), [@zexuann](https://github.com/zexuann) and [@kaieekkoh](https://github.com/kaieekkoh) - and I worked on this from Jan to May 2021. It was an end-to-end project, so we conducted periodic meetings with our clients and supervisors, found our data sources and experimented with various NLP techniques until we found what worked for our goal. The original repository has been kept private; this one doesn't contain all our scripts, but what's present is representative of our process.
